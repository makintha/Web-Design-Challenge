# Web-Design-Challenge

## Introduction
In this homework we are tasked to mimic website. The website itself presenting the result of our previous homework, where we are investigating the relation between latitude coordinate with various parameters, i.e. max temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed of a location on earth.

## Website Development
To develop the website, we are using the following tools:
- html language - as the main language
- for styling: 
    - css
    - bootstraps
- pandas - to generate table data

Each of the website pages, contain the same `navigation bar`, to navigate between pages. This `navbar` is responsive and fluid following the size of the screen. At certain `pixel` size will change background to lightseagreen.

Another features, is that when the `cursor` hover above the `navbar` the background will change to lightgray.

The followings are the structures of the repo:
